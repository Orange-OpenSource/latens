About Latens
======

Latens is an android application used to measure the end-to-end latency of touch interfaces such as tablets and smartphones under Android OS. The latency of an interactive system is the delay between a user's action and the corresponding feedback presented to the user. 

It is based on the work of François Bérard and Renaud Blanch (from LIG, University of Grenoble) in the following research publication: http://tripet.imag.fr/publs/2013/ITS13_Berard_LatencyEstimators.pdf

More precisely, we have implemented the Low Overhead (LO) approach, which does not require any additional equipment (such as an external calibrated camera) in addition of the touch device.
