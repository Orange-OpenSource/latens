About Latens
======

Latens is an android application used to measure the end-to-end latency of touch interfaces such as tablets and smartphones under Android OS. The latency of an interactive system is the delay between a user's action and the corresponding feedback presented to the user. Latency on direct-touch system is easy to perceive: even a small delay of 10 ms results in a visible spatial offset between the finger and the virtual object controlled by the finger. For Android smartphones such as Samsung Galaxy S2 we have measured delais of about 100 ms. The more the latency is reduced, the better the fluidity feeling and user control.

The principles used in this tool to estimate latencies are based on the research work of François Bérard and Renaud Blanch (from LIG, University of Grenoble) in the following research publication: http://tripet.imag.fr/publs/2013/ITS13_Berard_LatencyEstimators.pdf

More precisely, we have implemented the Low Overhead (LO) approach, which does not require any additional equipment (such as an external calibrated camera) in addition of the touch device.
